However, the PS3 Eye camera does not have an official driver for Windows 10, so you need to use a third-party driver to make it work. There are two main options for this: the CL Eye driver and the open driver. In this article, we will explain the differences between them and show you how to download and install them on your Windows 10 PC.
 
## The CL Eye Driver
 
The CL Eye driver is a commercial driver that provides video functionality with a single PS3 Eye camera on Windows XP/7/8. It works with many common apps and websites that use Microsoft Windows DirectShow Framework, such as Google Chrome, Skype, Adobe Flash, AIM, MSN Messenger, and more. It also offers a multicam SDK for developers who want to use up to 16 PS3 Eye cameras in their projects.
 
The CL Eye driver can be downloaded from the Code Laboratories website[^1^]. The driver costs $2.99 per camera license, but you can try it for free for 30 days. To install the CL Eye driver, follow these steps:
 
1. Download the CL Eye driver from the Code Laboratories website[^1^]. Choose the version that matches your Windows system (32-bit or 64-bit).
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen.
3. Restart your computer after the installation is complete.
4. Plug in your PS3 Eye camera to a USB port on your computer. The driver should automatically detect and install it.
5. Open the CL Eye Test program from the Start menu to test your camera. You can also use any other app or website that supports DirectShow.

## The Open Driver
 
The open driver is a free and open-source driver that provides video functionality with a single PS3 Eye camera on Windows 10. It works with opentrack, a head tracking software that allows you to control your mouse or game view with your head movements. It can also be used with other apps or websites that support DirectShow.
 
The open driver can be downloaded from the opentrack GitHub page[^2^]. To install the open driver, follow these steps:

1. Open the Windows Device Manager.
2. Uninstall any existing closed-source driver for the PS3 Eye camera.
3. Download and install the libusb inf wizard[^2^]. This is a tool that allows you to install drivers for USB devices.
4. Plug in your PS3 Eye camera to a USB port on your computer.
5. Run the libusb inf wizard and select your PS3 Eye camera from the list of devices.
6. Select "Install Now" and choose "libusb-win32 (v1.2.6.0)" as the driver.
7. Restart your computer after the installation is complete.
8. Open opentrack or any other app or website that supports DirectShow to use your camera.
