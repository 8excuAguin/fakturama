VRS TacPack is not a standalone product, but rather an addon that requires at least one [TacPack-Poweredâ¢ Aircraft](https://www.vrsimulations.com/tacpack.php) (available separately) in order to utilize the tactical systems. One of the most popular and realistic TacPack-Poweredâ¢ aircraft is the [VRS F/A-18E Superbug](https://www.vrsimulations.com/superbug.php), a highly detailed simulation of the US Navy's F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet.
 
However, VRS TacPack and its compatible aircraft are not cheap. The official price for VRS TacPack is $49.99 USD, and the VRS F/A-18E Superbug costs $54.99 USD. That's a total of $104.98 USD for the full experience. Not everyone can afford that kind of money, especially if they are not sure if they will like it or not.
